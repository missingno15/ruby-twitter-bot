ruby-twitter-bot
================

A Twitter bot in Ruby.


Running the Bot
================

Get your Twitter Keys for your bot application from https://dev.twitter.com/
Substitute the placeholder text in the config.yaml file with your keys.

Fill the messages.txt file with the tweet messages you want to tweet out.
Put them line by line as TwitterBot will read each message in that format.

If you are running a Windows machine, download the following file and make sure its the same directory as the other three files.
http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem

run 'ruby twitter_bot.rb'


Use TwitterBot responsibly. I am not responsible for your BS. Uploading TwitterBot to Github is primarily a way to showcase what I have done and to get feedback on how to improve it.
